# REMEMBER, REFACTORING SHOULD NOT AFFECT THE CODE'S BEHAVIOUR


# I want to print all numbers between 1 and 100. As you can see this is effort. Refactor this.
 
print "1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10......"

# I want all even numbers between 1 and 100. 

print '2, 4, 6, 8, 10......'

# Print All numbers between 1 and 500 backwards only if they are divisible by 7 on the same line
